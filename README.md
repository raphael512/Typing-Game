# Typing-Game
Words will fall out from the top, then the user will type those words to gain points. Failure to type a word will result to a loss of a life. You will have 3 lives in the game so, yeah, enjoy or idk.

Game is kinda laggy, idk maybe it's due to my code or because of python itself xD. 

Also sorry for the hehe.py, I'm too lazy to rename the file, it's just a file containing all the words that the game will display
